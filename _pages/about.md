Working in the Enterprise content management space for **12 years** has given me valuable insight into real world problems and solutions.
In the time I've been at BIS I've gotten married, and had 2 children, and my family is amazing.

I often find myself engaged in very technical projects,
both at home and work, so I created this site to share and inform about my personal skill set.

More coming soon.

## Introduction

For the uninititaed, Grooper could be described as capture software, and that's true, but we should compare Grooper to Legacy capture tools. All capture tools follow a simple pipeline.

Scan or Import, OCR, Review, and Export.

And at the other players fail at OCR right out of the gate. Grooper is modern and has the benefit of being built with massive parallel processing in mind.

## What is a Mill Test Report

A mill test report (MTR) often also called a certified mill test report, certified material test report, mill test certificate (MTC), inspection certificate, or certificate of test,
is a quality assurance document used in the metals industry, that certifies the material's chemical and physical properties, and states that the product complies with international standards such as ASTM, ASME, ISO, etc.

A mill test report is typically generated by the mill that created the material and is done by performing a variety of mechanical stresses/breaks, and mass spectrometry.
The report will show the elemental weights as carbon, phosphorus, silicon, etc, and the results of various mechanical tests. The material is tracked through unique identifiers such as its Heat ID or some Item/product ID.
to the front matter of the post. The table of contents will be automatically generated from the headings in the post.

## Challenges

Whether a business is manufacturing, redistributing, or making parts from metals, it becomes incumbent upon that business to certify or re-certify that the **Material Test Report** complies with the designation i.e ASTM A 572/572M - 21.
When a customer receives this document, usually as part of their receiving packet, they must validate that the data contained from the mill or third party is accurate and must re-certify the MTR.
This is done for a large variety of reasons including:

- Ensure that the material doesn't fail mechanically.
- Proof to secure bids or contracts.
- Early problem detection.
- Negotiate pricing on un-compliant materials.
- Prevent liability or litigation in the event of material failure.

This use case is largely motivated by loss avoidance and government regulation, and the "re-certification" process is slow and at risk of error.
The recertification of an MTR is typically performed by a knowledge worker, metallurgist, or material engineer; often this process is done manually, by locating the material standard, designation,
type on the MTR, and the reference document published by the international body.

ASTM is one of the internationial standard bodies, and is the most common we see in our practice. Let's breakdown the **ASTM Desigtnation System** using the following example.

**ASTM A 516/ A 516M-90 (2001) Grade 70 - Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon Steel, for Moderate and Lower Temperature Service**

- The "A" describes a ferrous metal, but does not subclassify it as cast iron, carbon steel, allow steel, or stainless steel.
- 516 is a sequential number without any relationship to the metal's properties.
- The "M" indicates that the standard A 516M is written in rationalized SI untis _(Metric)_. Therefore A 516/A 516M uses both inch-pound and SI untis.
- 90 indicates the year of adoption or last revision.
- (2001) is the year of last reapproval
- Grade 70 indicates the minimum tensile strength in ksi.

So let's look at our example in this image.

<div>
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/posts/mtr/mtr-example-zoom.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

In this example we see standard is ASTM, the designation is A 572, the grade is 65 \[450\], the type is 3, and the year is 2013. So our worker refers to the documentation for the standard.
the standard must be purchased again from the international body i.e. ASTM every time there is a new revision, usually 3 years.
Clients often prefer to certify to the latest year they have, and not the year found on the document.

Here is part of the ASTM A 572/A 572M - 21, that would allow a worker to determine if this MTR' Major elements are accurate.

<div>
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/posts/mtr/astm-572-chem.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

The current way of validating is 100% manual reading both the **MTR** and the **Designation** document and checking that the chemistry or property is valid.
Some organizations have developed they're own excel spreadsheets that have validation rules,
but the process is still manual, error prone, and slow.

However, if we read more carefully we can see there are nuances regarding **Manganese**.

> _B_ Manganse, minimum by heat analysis of 0.80 % (0.75 % by product analysis) shall be required for all plates over 3/8 in. [10 mm] in thickness; a minimum of 0.50 % (0.45 % by product analysis) shall be required for plates
> 3/8 in. [10 mm] and less in thickness, and for all other products. The manganese to carbon ratio shall not be less than 2 to 1.`

> _D_ For each reduction of 0.01 percentage point below the specified carbon maximum, an increase of 0.06 percentage point manage above the specified maximum is permitted, up to a maximum of 1.60.

The standards that yield from an international body are many and complex bringing in they're own sets of complexity and matricices.

After reading several dozen of these standard designations, I believe we can ontologically breakdown

### Standard Bodies

**ASTM International (ASTM)**

Formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM is a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of international voluntary consensus standards, including those for steel.

**International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**

ISO develops and publishes international standards for a wide range of industries, including the steel industry. ISO standards for steel cover everything from material properties to testing methods.

**European Committee for Standardization (CEN)**

CEN is responsible for developing European Standards (ENs) across various sectors, including steel. CEN standards are recognized across Europe and often harmonize with or complement ISO standards.

More strandard bodies:

- International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
- American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI)
- Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JISC)
- Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN)
- British Standards Institution (BSI)
- Russian Federal Agency on Technical Regulating and Metrology (Rosstandart)
- Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
- China Iron and Steel Association (CISA)
- Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR)
- Standards Australia
- Standards Council of Canada (SCC)

Many MTRs have multiple ways of presenting data, some tables are combined often to condense information on the page, as shown with the documents

<div>
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/posts/mtr/mtr-example-table.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
</div>

You can see that some of the properties like **Shear** are itterative this is not always the case, but we want to model the data in a way that could cover most MTRs
